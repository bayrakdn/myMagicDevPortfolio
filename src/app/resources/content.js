        I'm an Istanbul-based electrical and electronics engineering student with a strong passion for intelligent systems and sustainable mobility. Currently, I'm part of the AVT university team, where we're building an electric vehicle to compete in the TÃœBÄ°TAK efficiency challenge.

        <br />
        <br />

        My responsibilities include hardware design and battery system development, and I also contribute to the software and AI side â€” especially in embedded systems and intelligent control. I enjoy working across disciplines to solve real-world engineering problems and love creating systems where electronics and software come together in innovative ways.
